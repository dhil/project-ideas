# Project ideas

* SMLNJ.js: A JavaScript compiler for SML/NJ with continuations.
* LinksVM: A Gambit-like VM for Links client-side with effect handlers.
* Virtual machine for fast regular expression matching (Links; written in OCaml, cross-compiled to JavaScript).
* Optimiser for Links programs (common subexpression elimination, tree shaking, dead code elimination, elimination of redundant bindings, inlining, close local functions, operator strength reduction, list operator fusion)
* Exhaustive infinite search with effect handlers
* WasmFX projects
* Effect handling without tiers (distributed effect handling, work balancing, fault recovery)
* An algebraic theory of UNIX (or an equational theory for the UNIX operating system; algebraic operating systems)
* Evaluating effect handlers in C++ (e.g. different cpp-effects backends)
* Handlers for algebraic effects in Rust
* Dynamic optimisation of static scheduling (abstract effectful interface; run once to learn dependencies [maybe consider techniques to estimate runtime cost]; run again with "ideal" static schedule)
