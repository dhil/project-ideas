# Project ideas

* SMLNJ.js: A JavaScript compiler for SML/NJ with continuations.
* LinksVM: A Gambit-like VM for Links client-side with effect handlers.
* Virtual machine for fast regular expression matching (Links; written in OCaml, cross-compiled to JavaScript).
* Optimiser for Links programs (common subexpression elimination, tree shaking, dead code elimination, elimination of redundant bindings, inlining, close local functions, operator strength reduction, list operator fusion)
